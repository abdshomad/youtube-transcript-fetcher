### NE001 - Real YouTube API Integration
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Date**: 12 Nov 2025
- **Description**: The Gemini-powered simulation of the YouTube API has been replaced with a direct integration to the official YouTube Data API v3. The app now fetches live, real-world playlist data for both URL and topic-based inputs, making it a practical tool.

### NE002 - AI-Powered Transcript Summarization
- **Status**: Suggested
- **Date**: 11 Nov 2025
- **Description**: Add a "Summarize" feature within the transcript modal. This would use the Gemini API to generate a concise, bullet-point summary of the full transcript, allowing users to grasp the key points of a video quickly.

### NE003 - Key Topics & Concepts Extraction
- **Status**: Suggested
- **Date**: 11 Nov 2025
- **Description**: Use the Gemini API to analyze the transcript and extract a list of key topics, technical terms, or main concepts discussed. These could be displayed as clickable tags for quick navigation or reference.

### NE004 - Batch Transcript Generation
- **Status**: Suggested
- **Date**: 11 Nov 2025
- **Description**: Allow users to select multiple videos from the playlist view and generate transcripts for all of them in a single batch operation. The UI would show the progress for each video, and the results would automatically populate the download history.

### NE005 - User Accounts and Cloud Sync
- **Status**: Suggested
- **Date**: 11 Nov 2025
- **Description**: Implement a simple user authentication system. This would enable the synchronization of download history and edited transcripts across multiple devices, moving beyond browser-based local storage.

### NE006 - Multi-Language Transcript Support
- **Status**: Suggested
- **Date**: 11 Nov 2025
- **Description**: Add an option for the user to select a target language. The Gemini API would then generate the transcript in the specified language, making the tool useful for a global audience.

### NE007 - Advanced Prompt Customization
- **Status**: Suggested
- **Date**: 11 Nov 2025
- **Description**: For power users, provide an interface to view and edit the underlying prompts sent to the Gemini API. This would allow for fine-tuning the style, length, and format of both the generated playlists and transcripts.
